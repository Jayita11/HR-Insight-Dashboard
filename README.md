# Human Resources Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
The Human Resources Dashboard compiles and presents data from multiple organizational departments, delivering a thorough overview of crucial HR key performance indicators (KPIs). This tool enables HR teams to obtain a high-level understanding of their operations and investigate specific data correlations in greater detail. As a result, HR professionals can easily identify trends, formulate proactive strategies, and quickly uncover insights that enhance recruiting, optimize workplace management, and improve employee performance. By leveraging DAX and Power Pivot, the dashboard efficiently manages large datasets, making it a vital resource for effective HR analytics.

## Dataset Used
The dataset is in CSV format and has been cleaned and processed using Microsoft Excel's Power Query feature. This preprocessing ensures that the data is consistent and ready for analysis. The dataset includes transactional data from 2019 to 2021, stored in a Fact Table that contains essential details such as purchases, quantities, order dates, and key IDs for linking to Dimension Tables. These Dimension Tables are used to create relationships in Power Pivot, facilitating seamless data flow and comprehensive analysis during the dashboard creation process.

## Key Steps in the Project
- **Data Extraction and Transformation**:Utilized Power Query to extract raw, unstructured data and transform it into structured tabular data suitable for analysis.
- **Pivot Table Generation**:Created Pivot Tables to compile and summarize key HR data and generate comprehensive reports.
- **Excel Macros Development**:Developed Excel macros to automate the display and concealment of job categorization cards, enhancing the interactivity and usability of the dashboard.
- **Filter Automation**:utomated the removal of manual filters using macros and VBA, streamlining the data analysis process.
- **Formula Application**:Employed Excel formulae, including IF, COUNTA, and IF AND functions, to perform transition chart analysis and employee promotional analysis, providing deeper insights into HR metrics.

## Dashboard Components
- **5 Departments with the Highest Employees**: A bar chart showcasing the top five departments based on employee count.
